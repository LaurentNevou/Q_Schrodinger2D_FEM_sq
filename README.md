# Schrodinger2D_FEM_sq
This code solves the time independent Schroedinger equation in 2D with a constant mass on an inhomogeneous grid.
It uses the Finite Difference Method.
Three different potentials are proposed:

-> The Rectangular potential

-> The Elliptical potential

-> The Hexagonal potential

Any potential can be loaded with inhomogeneous grid x,y [m] and V [eV]
